# Python-Password-Generator

Tired of juggling logins and passwords? This Python program is your one-stop security shop!

Say goodbye to:

Weak passwords
Forgotten logins
Sticky notes all over the place
This program leverages your Python knowledge (including error handling!) to:

Generate rock-solid passwords: 12 digits of random characters, with a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for maximum strength.
Store your frequently visited websites: No more scrambling to remember which login goes where.
Craft personalized logins: Based on your preferences, it creates logins with a touch of you (think "loributterfliesgardening").
Here's how it works:

Simply launch the program and answer "Y" to get started.
The program will loop through your list of frequently visited websites.
For each site, it generates a strong password and a personalized login.
All this information is neatly stored in a dictionary for easy access.
Once you're done or all websites are covered, the program displays all the website names, logins, and passwords in a clear and organized table.
No more security headaches! This program is your key to a safer and more convenient online experience!
